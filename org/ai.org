** Probabilistic Reasoning
   [[file:~/studyguides/ai_materials/slides/midterm2/bayesian-slides.pdf#page=11][Bayesian Slides Probability]]

   *Probility* is the proportion of times something is true, 
   or a degree of belief in something

   Probabilities range in value from *0* to *1*.

   A *random variable* can take on values on a given *domain*.

   Since the value of the random variable is unknown, we assign a 
   *probability* to each value.

   This set of probabilities defines a *probability distribution*.
