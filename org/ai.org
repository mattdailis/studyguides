*** Definitions

**** Basics
    - *Probility* is the proportion of times something is true, 
    or a degree of belief in something

    - Probabilities range in value from *0* to *1*.

    - A *random variable* can take on values on a given *domain*.

    - Since the value of the random variable is unknown, we assign a *probability* to each value.

      - This set of probabilities defines a *probability distribution*.

    - The *sample space* is the domain of a random variable.

    - An *atomic event* is a possible situation.

    - A *[[file:ai_materials/slides/midterm2/bayesian-slides.pdf#page=24][joint probability distribution]]* is the vector distribution of 
      several different random variables.
      
      - The distribution itself is ~P(X, Y, Ø)~

      - The atomic situation is ~P(X = 1, Y = 2, Ø = 3)~, which reads
	"X = 1 AND Y = 2 AND Ø"

    - An *a priori* or *unconditional* does not depend on any condition
