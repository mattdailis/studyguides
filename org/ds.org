* Synchronization and Communication
  A *Distributed system* consists of physically distributed 
  resources (hardware and software) which are connected via 
  a network and are able to collaborate to accomplish a given
  task.
** Processes and threads
   A process can consist of one execution flow (monothread) or 
   more (multithread).

   Each thread has its own:
   - Program counter / Registers
   - Stack
   - Status (executing, ready, blocked)

   Threads of the same process share:
   - a memory space.
   - global variables
   - open files
   - child processes
   - timers
   - signals and semaphores
   - statistics

** Concurrency
   Separate a step of the program that can be modularized and run
   parallel and independent from the others.

   When one is blocked, the others can continue executing.
